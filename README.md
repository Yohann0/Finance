# Finance

This repository contains my personal finance projects. Currently, it includes the following projects:

### **Interest Rate Models**
- **HJM Model**: A Python notebook that develops the main theoretical results of the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) framework. It uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Monte Carlo simulations to price a caplet.
- **Hull-White Model**: A Python notebook that explores theoretical results of the Hull-White model and applies it to price interest rate derivatives, including caps, swaps, and swaptions.

### **Trading Strategies**
- **Momentum Trading Strategy**: A Python notebook implementing a momentum trading strategy across different assets, including a MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) strategy.
- **Pairs Trading Strategy**: A Python notebook that implements a pairs trading strategy with Bayesian optimization.

### **Option Pricing**
- **Option Pricing, Greeks, and Implied Volatility in Python**: A Python notebook that prices options using various methods (Black-Scholes, Binomial Tree, Monte Carlo, Finite Difference), calculates Greeks, and analyzes volatility smiles.
- **Option Pricing in C++**: A C++ implementation for pricing options using different methods (Black-Scholes, Binomial Tree, Monte Carlo, Finite Difference).

### **Portfolio Construction**
- **Smart Beta**: A Python notebook that constructs an Equally Risk-Contributed portfolio using classical ETFs based on the S&P 500 (Quality, Value, Dividends, Momentum, Low Volatility, Market Cap).

### **Sentiment Analysis**
- **Sentiment Analysis from Financial News**: A Python notebook that performs sentiment analysis on financial news to extract insights.

### **Other Projects**
In the **"Other Projects"** folder, I have included the report of my **EPFL project** on an educational chatbot. While not directly related to finance, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has broad applications, including potential use cases in quantitative finance.
