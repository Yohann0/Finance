# Finance
This repository contains my personal finance projects. For the moment, it contains the following projects:
- HJM model: a Python notebook that develops the main theoretical HJM result and use it with Principal Component Analysis and Monte Carlo simulations to price a caplet
- Momentum trading strategy: a Python notebook that implements a momentum trading strategy on different assets and a MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) strategy
- Option pricing, greeks, implied vol in Python: a Python notebook that prices options using different methods (Black-Scholes, Binomial Tree, Monte Carlo, Finite Difference), calculates greeks and volatility smile
- Option pricing in C++: a C++ notebook that prices options using different methods (Black-Scholes, Binomial Tree, Monte Carlo, Finite Difference)
- Pairs trading strategy: a Python notebook that implements a pairs trading strategy with Bayesian optimization
- Sentiment analysis from financial news: a Python notebook that performs sentiment analysis on financial news

In the "Other projects" folder, I have included the report of my EPFL project on an educational chatbot. Even if it is not directly related to finance, Natural Language Processing has applications in every field, and may be applied to quantitative finance.
